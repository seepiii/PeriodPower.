                Period poverty is a saddening, yet prevalent issue in this
                modern day world. It is the lack of access to sanitary products,
                education, and facilities during menstruation due to financial
                constraints and/or social stigma. According to The World Bank,
                500 million people lack access to menstrual products and hygiene
                facilities around the world. Menstrual products should be a
                basic right for people that experience periods.

            &quot;Growing up in a low-income family, I never gave much thought
            to menstrual products. I knew they were expensive and we
            couldn&apos;t afford them, so I just used old rags and hoped for the
            best. It wasn&apos;t until I was in high school that I realized the
            true impact of period poverty.

          <br class="home-text25" />
          <span class="home-text26">
            I remember one day, I bled through my makeshift pad during class. I
            was mortified and couldn&apos;t focus on anything else for the rest
            of the day. That&apos;s when I knew something had to change.
          </span>
          <br class="home-text27" />
          <br class="home-text28" />
          <span class="home-text29">
            I started researching period poverty and found out that it was a
            widespread issue, affecting not just me but countless others in my
            community. I decided to take action and started a menstrual product
            drive at my school. I collected donations of pads and tampons, and
            distributed them to low-income students in my school.
          </span>
          <br class="home-text30" />
          <br class="home-text31" />
          <span class="home-text32">
            It was a small step, but it made a huge impact. Seeing the relief on
            my classmates&apos; faces as they received the products they needed
            was truly heartwarming. I knew I had to do more.
          </span>

          <br class="home-text34" />
          <span class="home-text35">
            I started working with local organizations to raise awareness about
            period poverty and advocate for menstrual equity. I also started a
            scholarship to help low-income students afford menstrual products.

            It&apos;s been a few years since I graduated, but I&apos;m still
            passionate about fighting period poverty. I know that by working
            together, we can make sure that no one has to suffer through their
            menstrual cycle alone.&quot;
